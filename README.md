# IP Street Claim Parser API

These provide basic examples of how to interact with the IP Street /claim_parser/ endpoint.

Each script accepts a patent number, calls the API endpoint printing the response to console, and finally downloads the associated .csv to the a user defined location.

Prior to running these scripts, you must replace ```"YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"``` with you IP Street API key and replace ```"YOUR_DOWNLOAD_TARGET_LOCATION_GOES_HERE"``` with the location where you would like the .csv files saved.
